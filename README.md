# Word Count

Count the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in some text.

## Tips

- The command will automatically count any text in your clipboard. To clear, use `⌘ + E`.
- Whitespace is ignored by default when counting characters. To toggle whitespace counting, use `⌘ + T`.

### Count from Screenshot (macOS only)

Capture any text on screen and get instant character, word, sentence, and paragraph counts using OCR.

**Requirements:** This feature requires the [ScreenOCR](https://www.raycast.com/huzef44/screenocr) extension to be installed.

- Press `Esc` to cancel screenshot capture
- Works best with clear, high-contrast text
